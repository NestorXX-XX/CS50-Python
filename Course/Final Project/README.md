#### Description:

Overview:

The "Flashcards" project is designed to assist users in language learning by providing a simple and user-friendly interface. It offers three main functionalities: creating a flashcard, deleting a flashcard, and working with flashcards. The program ensures that users can seamlessly manage their flashcards and make the most of their language learning journey.

Key Features:

Create Flashcards: Users can easily create new flashcards to add to their language learning collection. They are prompted to enter both the Spanish word and its corresponding English translation. Exiting the flashcard creation is as simple as typing "exit" when providing the Spanish word.

Delete Flashcards: Users have the option to delete flashcards from their collection. The program displays a list of existing flashcards, allowing users to choose the one they wish to remove.

Work with Flashcards: Users can study or practice their flashcards. When in "study" mode, the program presents flashcards and their Spanish words for users to review. In "practice" mode, users are prompted for the English translation, testing their language comprehension.

Data Persistence: The program saves all flashcards in a CSV file. This means that even if you close the program, your flashcards will be available when you run it again. This feature ensures that users' progress and created flashcards are always accessible.

Usage:

When you start the program, you're presented with a menu where you can choose to create a new flashcard, delete an existing flashcard, or work with flashcards.
The program will check if you have any flashcards before allowing you to delete or work with them. If you don't have any flashcards yet, it will inform you.
To create a new flashcard, you will provide the Spanish word and its English translation. Typing "exit" in the Spanish prompt allows you to exit the creation process.
To delete a flashcard, you will choose the flashcard you want to remove from your collection.
When working with flashcards, you have the choice of studying or practicing. Studying involves reviewing flashcards, while practicing tests your ability to provide English translations.

Summary:

The "Flashcards" project is a language learning tool that simplifies the process of creating, managing, and using flashcards. Whether you're a language enthusiast or a beginner, this project helps you enhance your language skills with an easy-to-use and efficient interface. It's an excellent resource for anyone looking to learn a new language or improve their existing language skills.
